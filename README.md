# Claude Code Workarounds

A collection of daily workarounds and fixes for common issues when using Claude Code.

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and utilities to solve frequent problems encountered while using Claude Code. Each tool addresses specific limitations or bugs that affect daily workflow.

## Current Tools

### wsl-paste-workaround.py
Enables image pasting when using Claude Code through WSL.

**What it does:**
- Captures images from Windows clipboard when using Shift+Insert
- Automatically saves images to a `sharedclaude` folder
- Pastes the correct `@sharedclaude/filename.png` format into terminal

**When to use:**
- Working with Claude Code in WSL environment
- Need to paste images from Windows clipboard
- Want automatic image organization in shared folder

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run with admin privileges (recommended)
python wsl-paste-workaround.py /path/to/your/project

# Use WSL/Linux path format instead of Windows paths
python wsl-paste-workaround.py /path/to/your/project --wsl

# Or provide path interactively
python wsl-paste-workaround.py
```

**Command Line Options:**
- `--wsl`: When enabled, Ctrl+Shift+Insert will paste Linux-style paths (e.g., `/mnt/c/Users/...`) instead of Windows paths (e.g., `C:\Users\...`). Useful when working in WSL terminals that expect Linux path format.

**How it works:**
- If path doesn't end with `sharedclaude`, creates that subdirectory automatically
- Press Shift+Insert to capture clipboard image and paste `@sharedclaude/filename.png`
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Insert to paste full absolute path (Windows or WSL format based on `--wsl` flag)
- Images auto-delete after 5 minutes
- Press Ctrl+C to stop

### UpdateFix.sh
Fixes Claude update issues when it claims another instance is updating.

**When to use:**
- Claude says it's outdated but update fails
- Gets "another instance is updating" error when no other instance exists

**Usage:**
```bash
./UpdateFix.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Cleans up stuck update locks
- Runs Claude update
- Removes outdated Claude binaries
- Refreshes shell cache
